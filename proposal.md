# Proposal

## What will (likely) be the title of your project?

 The Cryptocurrency Predictor 

## In just a sentence or two, summarize your project. (E.g., "A website that lets you buy and sell stocks.")

A program that lets you pick a cryptocurrency and view its predicted price within a specific amount of days. 

## In a paragraph or more, detail your project. What will your software do? What features will it have? How will it be executed?

Initially, the software will ask you which cryptocurrency you would like to predict the price of. Then, it will ask you how many days forward you would like to see the price of. If you do not know which currency you would like to choose then you can pick a randomized cryptocurrency. It will then ask how many days forward you would like to predict the price of. Furthermore, you will see a line graph displaying the name of the cryptocurrency, dates, and prices for those dates. This will be executed through entering it into the program or through a discord command (this has yet to be determined).

## If planning to combine 1051's final project with another course's final project, with which other course? And which aspect(s) of your proposed project would relate to 1051, and which aspect(s) would relate to the other course?

TODO, if applicable

## If planning to collaborate with 1 or 2 classmates for the final project, list their names, email addresses, and the names of their assigned TAs below.

## In the world of software, most everything takes longer to implement than you expect. And so it's not uncommon to accomplish less in a fixed amount of time than you hope.

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a GOOD outcome for your final project. I.e., what WILL you accomplish no matter what?

No matter what we will have a way to choose a cryptocurrency, the days predicted, display a graph, and have a randomizer. 

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a BETTER outcome for your final project. I.e., what do you THINK you can accomplish before the final project's deadline?

A better outcome would be to have all of these features as a discord bot and an animation.

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a BEST outcome for your final project. I.e., what do you HOPE to accomplish before the final project's deadline?

The best outcome is having all of those features both as a discord bot and an animation. 

## In a paragraph or more, outline your next steps. What new skills will you need to acquire? What topics will you need to research? If working with one of two classmates, who will do what?

I will work on the animation and randomization part of the project. I will have to learn how to use PyGame, to animate the graph and fortune wheel thingie we have planned for the randomization part of it. Yuval will do the graph and discord bot part of it. We will split up the data prediction part of it.

# Preproposal

## What idea(s) do you have for your final project?

One idea I had was to download some background images and use them in a turtle minigame similar to what we did with the hurricane project. I don't know what the game would be, but I think it would be very cool to have a turtle respond to your actions in real time. I don't even know if Python allows that, but I really hope it does. 
Another idea I had was to have someone input how much they eat calorie wise in a day and how much they exercise, and do a basic calorie counter type app. That's pretty unoriginal, but I couldn't come up with much else. 

## If you plan to collaborate with one or two classmates, what are their names?

I plan to collaborate with Yuval Shimoni

## Do you have any questions of your own?

Not yet. I haven't started my projects yet, but I'm sure I'll run into areas where I need help.
